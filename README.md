# NetworkTools
From Sebastien Martin
**Work still in progress** 
- Loads routing network from OpenStreetMap OSM files
- Can also create virtual routing networks
- visualize them with SFML

# Update for Julia 1.x: 
- Migrated from SFML to CSFML bindings
- Updated modules and struct format to July 1.8.5
- Updated dependency
Only work on virtual routing networks :\, our hardware did not suffice the requirements
Has not fixed OSM file for real data, will work on that if time is allowed.
Haven't figured out how to register this repo into legit julia package, it may be troublesome implement it locally. 
If u don't want to waste time to use original code, i've wasted for ya. 

System spec used: 
- Window 10
- Julia 1.8.5
